            <h1>THE FOREST SCHOOL HACKATHON: IGNITING INNOVATION</h1>
            <h3><i>Unlock your coding destiny.</i></h3>
            <p>Karim and Keon are proud to present its inaugural Hackathon, a thrilling coding event designed to foster creativity, collaboration, and real-world problem-solving among our brightest minds. Over the course of 6 months, students will dive deep into the digital realm, turning abstract ideas into tangible solutions that can lead to technological breakthroughs.
<br>
<b>Who Can Participate?</b>
<br>
Open exclusively to GCSE students of The Forest School, this event calls upon coders, designers, and innovators to come together in teams and harness the power of technology.
<br>
<b>What's the Goal?</b>
<br>
The objective is simple yet challenging: identify a problem, conceptualize a solution, and develop a prototype all within the duration of the Hackathon. Projects can range from software applications to data analysis frameworks, from AI-driven tools to digital games â€” anything that shows the promise of computer science.
<br>
<b>Why Join?</b>
<br>
Enhance your coding prowess, learn new frameworks, and polish your problem-solving skills.
<br>
Collaborate with peers, learn from mentors, and engage with experts in various tech fields.
<br>
Use this platform to bring your most innovative ideas to life and make an impact.
<br>
Outstanding projects will be recognized and awarded, with opportunities for further development.
<br>
<b>How Does It Work?</b>
<br>
1) Register as a group or sign up individually.
<br>
2) Attend the opening ceremony to learn about the themes and guidelines.
<br>
3) Spend the next 6 months creating your project, with resources and mentors at hand.
<br>
4) Follow the submission guidelines to enter your project for judging.
<br>
5) Showcase your work to judges and peers.
<br>
6) Celebrate success, innovation, and hard work as we wrap up with awards and recognitions.
<br>
